## Introduction

In today's data-driven world, efficient storage solutions are essential. FileDB offers a lightweight and fast key-value store that operates directly on disk, making it suitable for various applications. It is designed to handle large volumes of data while ensuring quick access and low latency.

## Features

- **Disk-Based Storage**: Store data directly on disk for better performance and scalability.
- **Inspired by Bitcask**: Leverage the efficient storage model of Bitcask for optimal data handling.
- **Simple API**: Use a straightforward API for easy integration into your projects.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead ensures that you can focus on your application rather than the storage mechanism.
- **Data Persistence**: Ensure data durability even in case of system failures.

## Getting Started

To get started with FileDB, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/varunsamudrala/filedb/releases). Download the appropriate file, execute it, and you will be ready to use FileDB in your projects.

## Usage

FileDB provides a simple interface for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. Hereâ€™s a quick example to demonstrate its usage:

```python
from filedb import FileDB

# Initialize the database
db = FileDB('path/to/database')

# Store a value
db.set('key1', 'value1')

# Retrieve a value
value = db.get('key1')
print(value)  # Output: value1
```

This example shows how easy it is to store and retrieve data using FileDB. You can adapt this to fit your specific needs.

## Architecture

FileDB uses a combination of techniques inspired by the Bitcask model to manage data efficiently. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of its architecture:

1. **Log-Structured Storage**: Data is written sequentially to a log file, which enhances write performance.
2. **Compaction**: Periodically, the log file is compacted to reclaim space and improve read performance.
3. **Indexing**: An in-memory index maps keys to their respective locations in the log file, allowing for quick lookups.

This architecture allows FileDB to achieve high throughput and low latency for both read and write operations.
